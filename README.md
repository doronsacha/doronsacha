### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Sacha Slomovits - Software Developer Intern at Cadence Design Systems 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sacha, a final semester Computer Science student at the Technion, currently interning as a Software Developer at Cadence Design Systems in India. My journey in the tech world is driven by a passion for backend development, a keen interest in storage solutions, and container orchestration technologies.

#### About Me
ðŸ“š Education: My education at the Technion has instilled in me a rigorous approach to problem-solving and a methodical way of thinking, greatly benefiting my projects and work ethic. My academic journey is complemented by personal studies, especially in the realms of data structures and algorithms, enabling me to tackle complex problems efficiently. Currently, I'm diving deep into Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, with a particular focus on data storage technologies.

ðŸ’¼ Work: At Cadence, I thrive as a Software Developer Intern, tackling issues and enhancing application performance with my skills in C++ and Tcl. My role involves coding robust solutions and constantly seeking ways to improve our software's architecture and user experience.

ðŸŒ± Learning Goals: Fascinated by the complexities of backend development, I'm always on the lookout to expand my knowledge. Recently, I've developed an interest in Kubernetes, thanks to a project at Dell where I had the opportunity to create an operator in Go. My aim is to contribute to open-source projects, especially those revolving around storage solutions and Kubernetes, to further hone my skills in these areas.

#### Technical Skills
##### Languages: 
Proficient in C++ (solid), Tcl (excellent), Go, and Python. Familiar with SQL through academic projects.
##### Technologies: 
Deeply interested in Kubernetes, with practical experience in developing a Go operator. Strong background in backend development, with a knack for designing and managing SQL databases, as demonstrated in a school project resembling a simplified Airbnb platform.
##### Frameworks/Tools: 
Adept at using Linux-based development environments, with practical experience in scripting and automation using Bash.
#####Core Competencies: 
Exceptionally strong in data structures and algorithms, a skill honed through personal study, my academic curriculum, and practical work experiences. This foundational knowledge has been crucial in my development work and problem-solving abilities.

#### Looking Forward
As I approach the culmination of my studies, I'm eager to immerse myself in the open-source community, particularly in projects that align with my interests in storage solutions and Kubernetes. My goal is to leverage my academic knowledge and practical experience to make meaningful contributions to these projects, while also seeking opportunities to grow in areas like cloud computing.
